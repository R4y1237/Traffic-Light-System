# Traffic-Light-System

## Description
Simulates a T-intersection traffic light system while constantly checking for the light level for the streetlight independently of the traffic light system.

## How it works
`Traffic_Light.ino` contains all code used in the system. Coded in C++ and is put into an Arduino Microcontroller to control the traffic light model

`Tej_Circuit.png` is a picture displaying the wiring and connections of each component of the traffic light model

`traffic light (1).png` is a rendered model of the traffic light system that I later built in real life. 

`TEJ ISP - Final Report.pdf` is a final report on the project, including a more detailed description of how it works.
